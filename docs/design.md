## Overview
The system uses a 12-column grid layout enforced by literal border lines (dividers). It evokes a blueprint or technical drawing feel through visible structural axes and monochromatic depth.

## Colors
Concentrated on deep blacks and varied shades of zinc/neutral gray. The core palette uses transparency for glass effects (glass-panel) and subtle background patterns (linear-gradient grid) to create depth without vibrant color.

## Typography
Relies heavily on the 'Geist' typeface for a modern, engineering-focused look. Typography is hierarchical: massive display sizes for headers, comfortable sans-serif for reading, and wide-spaced monospace for technical metadata and labels.

## Spacing
Based on a modular scale where 8px is the base unit. Hero sections utilize significant vertical padding (96px+) to create air and focus, while UI elements use tight internal spacing for a precise, compact feel.

## Layout
Uses a 'Global Wrapper' restricted to 1400px with a persistent center-aligned container. Vertical and horizontal borders define the visual architecture (divide-y and divide-x), effectively turning the layout into a responsive spreadsheet of content blocks.

## Elevation & Depth
Depth is achieved through backdrop filters (12px blur) rather than drop shadows. The background features a fixed 60px grid pattern that remains stationary while content scrolls over it, creating a multi-layered parallax effect.

## Shapes
Predominantly sharp corners. Rounded tokens are used sparingly for small utility badges (4px) or full circular pills for status indicators. This maintains a professional, 'architectural' aesthetic.

## Components
- Navigation: Sticky glass panel with equidistant links and a pulsed contact indicator.
- Experience Sidebar: A vertical stack of high-density text blocks with metadata labels.
- Horizontal Scroller: An auto-scrolling gallery using masking gradients to fade out edges.
- Project Tiles: Interactive zones that feature icon backgrounds and transform-based arrow indicators on hover.

## Motion
Subtle but persistent. Includes an infinite-scroll marquee for portfolios, a heartbeat pulse for availability markers, and grayscale-to-color transitions for imagery to reward user interaction.

## Do's and Don'ts
- Do use uppercase for secondary labels and buttons.
- Do keep border widths consistent at 1px.
- Don't introduce vibrant gradients; stick to white/black transparency shifts.
- Don't break the vertical line alignment between the header and main content sections.

## Accessibility
Text contrast is maintained via Neutral-100 on Black. Interactive states should provide both a color change and a transform (like the arrow rotation) to ensure affordances are visible to all users.
