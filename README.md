# 🎓 Rakha Putra Pebri Yandra - Portfolio Website

A modern, responsive portfolio website showcasing my academic achievements, professional experience, research, and technical skills as an Information Systems graduate.

The portfolio is designed to present my versatility across multiple IT functions, including software development, systems analysis, QA automation, and technology consulting, rather than locking me into a single technical role.

    cd web-port
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:

3.  Start dev server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
4.  Open browser:

## ⚙️ Customization Guide

All text content is decoupled from components. To update content, modify the corresponding JSON files in `src/data/`:
*   **Skills & Tech Stack**: Edit `src/data/skills.json` to change technology listings, learning milestones, or proficiency numbers.
*   **Work Experience**: Edit `src/data/history.json` to modify timeline descriptions, job roles, or technologies.
*   **Project Showcase**: Edit `src/data/projects.json` to update links, teams, descriptions, or change filters.
*   **Organizations & Leadership**: Edit `src/data/organizations.json` to adjust roles, details, or achievements.
*   **Academic Publications**: Edit `src/data/publications.json` to edit research papers or add recruiter summaries.

## 📈 Performance & Accessibility (a11y)

*   **Manual Chunking**: Large dependencies like `react` and `react-dom` are bundled separately from utility scripts, optimizing network loading.
*   **Terser Minification**: Compresses compiled code files and strips debugger statements in the production build.
*   **Reduced Motion**: Key animations respect screen accessibility preference variables, disabling motion elements for sensitive viewers.
*   **Image Optimization**: Preloads critical assets while using `preconnect` headers for Google fonts. Defer loading of non-critical items using custom observers.
